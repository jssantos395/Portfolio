        <p>MY name is Jason Santos. I am a first generation Portuguese-American. My parents immigrated to america at 25 years old, bringing two children with them.
        Their goal was to give their children a better life and they believed America was the place to do that.
        After settling down in America my parents had my older brother and me, now with 4 sons. I am the youngest of the bunch, which has allowed me to learn a lot from my family.
        I spent most of my time growing up playing high level soccer in the NY/NJ area. I then went on the play soccer at Loyola University Maryland. I graduated Loyola
        with a BBA and a concentration in Finance and a minor in Information Systems. Shortly after graduation I landed my first job as a Data Analyst for Charter Communications.
        A few years later I landed another job with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. In between jobs I always had a spot at the family bakery - Euro Fresh Bakery.</p>

        <h3 class="bio-text2">Euro Fresh Bakery</h3>
        <p>Euro Fresh Bakery is our familys second home. Honestly, the bakery helped shaped me into the person I am today. A family business is no joke, the joke is working with family...
        Long days and early mornings helped me understand the work ethic that got my parents everything they have ever dreamed of. Early mornings meant waking up at 1am to go bake bread.
        Only to end the day around 12pm when the front of the restaurant started to slow down. At the bakery I was my parents right hand man. I would help with everything from the bills and paper work
        to working in the back baking bread and also helping in the front of the store waiting on customers. The bakery taught me a lot about life and the struggles of being an immigrant family.
        Without it I wouldn't be the person I am today but with a college degree I knew I wanted more. I have always dreamed of being a software developer and I knew the GA was my chance.</p>
